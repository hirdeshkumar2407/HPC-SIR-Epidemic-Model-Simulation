This project explores a proof-of-concept simulation framework that adapts the classical SIR (Susceptible-Infected-Recovered) model to traffic systems. Rather than fully realizing smart road infrastructure, our focus is on demonstrating how epidemic modeling techniques can be extended to represent transitions between normal, smart, and blocked vehicle states. Road segments are treated as cells in a 2D spatial grid, and system dynamics are computed using a 4th-order Runge-Kutta method. To enable scalable simulations, we implement a parallel version using MPI with ghost cell exchange between partitions. We validate the framework using processed data derived from the JHU COVID-19 dataset and provide an analysis of model behavior and scalability. This foundational work lays the groundwork for future extensions toward more comprehensive smart road simulations.
